== Configuring password resets

Cog uses email for its password reset process. To enable Cog to send emails you will need to configure SMTP. Like most things in Cog, SMTP is configured via environment variables. See <<Cog Server Configuration, SMTP configuration>> for information on which vars to set.

Additionally you must provide who the password reset request email is from. This would most likely be something like "\support@mydoman.com" or "\no-reply@mydomain.com". This is done with the <<Cog Server Configuration, `COG_EMAIL_FROM`>> var.

Optionally, if you are providing a custom form for password resets you can set the <<Cog Server Configuration, `COG_PASSWORD_RESET_BASE`>>. It should be noted that this is for advanced users wanting to provide custom UI to their users.
